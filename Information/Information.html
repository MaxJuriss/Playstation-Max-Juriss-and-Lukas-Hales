            <b>Playstations are special they have a diffrent feel than all the other game consoles because the controllers are alot smaller than all the the other gaming controllers and this fact tells me that it can just fit in the palm of your hand, when I first got my PS4 I was quite suprised because I come from a family that really just used Xboxs before but a while ago we had a PS2 which my oldest brother has curently I remeber coming home from getting my silver caps on my teeth and getting to play on the PS2 straight away even though my oldest brother was already playing it.</b> Sony Phone:1-800-345-7669
